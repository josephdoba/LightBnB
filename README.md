# LightBnB

## An AirBnB clone during my studies at Lighthouse labs

In this project, we learned about SQL, and gained an understanding of Relation Databases and RDBMS's.. For this project specifically we used Postgres. All of the work I did is located in `database.js`.

### Setup:

* setup instructions such as how to install and run
* consider adding some screenshots of the project.

### Depenencies: 

* bcrypt
* body-parser
* cookie-session
* express
* nodemon
* pg

* `public` contains all of the HTML, CSS, and client side JavaScript. 
  * `index.html` is the entry point to the application. It's the only html page because this is a single page application.
  * `javascript` contains all of the client side javascript files.
    * `index.js` starts up the application by rendering the listings.
    * `network.js` manages all ajax requests to the server.
    * `views_manager.js` manages which components appear on screen.
    * `components` contains all of the individual html components. They are all created using jQuery.
* `sass` contains all of the sass files. 
* `server` contains all of the server side and database code.
  * `server.js` is the entry point to the application. This connects the routes to the database.
  * `apiRoutes.js` and `userRoutes.js` are responsible for any HTTP requests to `/users/something` or `/api/something`. 
  * `json` is a directory that contains a bunch of dummy data in `.json` files.
  * `database.js` is responsible for all queries to the database. The work on it is to demonstrate how to connect and work with databases in the scope of web development. It has been refactored to connect to a local database. Originally it retrieved all data from internal `.json` files.
